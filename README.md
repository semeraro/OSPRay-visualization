# OSPRay-visualization
A collection of example programs that exercises the OSPRay API. The collection is a result of my exploration of the
OSPRay API. It is an archive of my experiments. I started experimenting in order to discover how OSPRay works and become
more familiar with the various controls and parameters available through the API. Most of my previous experience with 
OSPRay has been through use of the renderer in Paraview. While this approach proved adequate for most purposes I suspected
I could do more interesting things with the software by directly utilizing the API. 

My experiments go from basic to more advanced. The repo has a src directory that contains all the code. The organization of src
sort of follows the API documentation. Each subdirectory of src contains code related to the subsection fo the API documentation,... almost. 

## Experiments
### Hello
This C++ example is the osptutorial example from the OSPRay distro. I used this 
example to set up my development environment.
### Objects
#### Spheres
This example creates a set of 8 spheres arranged in a cube pattern.
